## Introduction

In this Data Science Capstone, Johns Hopkins partnered with SwiftKey to create a
project where we work on predictive text analytics.
The goal for this project is to create an app that predicts the next word based 
on a string of words provided by the user.
The Shiny App can be found [here](https://practicingr.shinyapps.io/CapstoneApp/) and the coding can be found
[here](https://github.com/practicingR/Data-Science-Capstone).

## Exploring and Cleaning the Data

We used three files to create our prediction model from: en_US.blog.txt,
en_US.news.txt, and en_US.twitter.txt.

We used 10% of each data set to create a sample data set. We then cleaned the
sample data to make all words lowercase and remove all punctuation, numbers, and
white spaces usuing Corpus.

Then, we used ngrams and tokenization to create a function that counts the 
frequency of each word or word combination. We then created 4 separate files
labeled unigram (one word list), bigram (two words list), trigram (three words 
list), and quadgram (four words list).



## Description of Algorithm used to make Prediction
The app first takes in a string a words from the user.

To make a prediction on the next word, the algorithm first looked at the quadgram
file to compare to the last three words inputted by the user and see if any matched.
If not, then it would look at the trigam file and look at the last two words the user
inputted to see if any matched. If not, this same process was repeated for the 
bigram and the unigram files to see if any matched.
